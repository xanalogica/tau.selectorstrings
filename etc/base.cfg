#			  The order in which elements are listed in extends=

#			  later NAME=VALUE elements override earlier ones.  In

#			  erronenously specified in the
#			  etc/versions-Zope2.12.10 that apply to old versions
#			  of recipes.
#
#			  The reason the Zope2 versions are specified in a
#			  local file is so that we can run buildouts without
#			  having public Internet access.
